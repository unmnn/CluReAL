Description: 'CluReAL' is a port of the Python implementation of the algorithm 
    'CluReAL.v2', which is designed improve an existing clustering solution by 
    splitting multimodal clusters, merging akin clusters, and marking tiny 
    or low-density clusters as outliers (noise). Additionally, symbolic key 
    ideograms can be created to interpret clusters in high-dimensional space. 
    The approach is described in detail in the article by Iglesias et al. (2021)
